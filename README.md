# YouTube-Tools

This repo is mainly for some tools I've built that I'm using personally to help display channel growth. 

### Tools 
<i> there's only the one so far </i> 

- Playlist Views Visualizer
	- Displays the amount of viewers per video in a giveo playlist 
	- Videos tht released on Fri-Sun are displayed in black, others are displayed in grey. 
	- Provide the PlaylistID in the `playlistID` variable. 
	- Currently this is using my personal Google API key. I think that's fine for now? I may have to change that if everyone breaks stuff though. 
		- In the future, I'll include a variable where you can put in your own API key.
